As a conflict method that has survived and evolved through several
millennia to flourish in the modern information age, terrorism
continues to adapt to meet the challenges of emerging forms of
conflict, and exploit developments in technology and society.
Terrorism has demonstrated increasing abilities to adapt to
counter-terrorism measures and political failure. Terrorists are
developing new capabilities of attack and improving the efficiency of
existing methods. Additionally, terrorist groups have shown
significant progress in escaping from a subordinate role in
nation-state conflicts, and becoming prominent as international
influences in their own right. They are becoming more integrated with
other sub-state entities, such as criminal organizations and
legitimately chartered corporations, and are gradually assuming a
measure of control and identity with national governments.</p><br/>

<p class="lead">
Terrorists have shown the ability to adapt to the techniques and
methods of counter-terror agencies and intelligence organizations over
the long term. The decentralization of the network form of
organization is an example of this. Adopted to reduce the disruption
caused by the loss of key links in a chain of command, a network
organization also complicates the tasks of security forces, and
reduces predictability of operations.</p><br/>

<ins><h3>Increasing Capabilities of Terrorists</h3></ins>
<p class="lead">
Terrorists are improving their sophistication and abilities in
virtually all aspects of their operations and support. The aggressive
use of modern technology for information management, communication and
intelligence has increased the efficiency of these activities. Weapons
technology has become more increasingly available, and the purchasing
power of terrorist organizations is on the rise. The ready
availability of both technology and trained personnel to operate it
for any client with sufficient cash allows the well-funded terrorist
to equal or exceed the sophistication of governmental
