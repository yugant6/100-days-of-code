<h2>Evolution of Terrorism</h2>
<br />
<img src="images/4.jpg" class="img-rounded" height="400" width="700">
<p class="lead">
Terrorism is continually changing. While at the surface it remains
<ins>"the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful
violence to inculcate fear"</ins> it is rapidly becoming the predominant
strategic tool of our adversaries. As terrorism evolves into the
principal irregular warfare strategy of the 21st century, it is
adapting to changes in the world socio-political environment. Some of
these changes facilitate the abilities of terrorists to operate,
procure funding, and develop new capabilities. Other changes are
gradually moving terrorism into a different relationship with the
world at large.</p><br/>

<p class="lead">In order to put these changes into context, it will be necessary to
look at the historical evolution of terrorism, with each succeeding
evolution building upon techniques pioneered by others. This evolution
is driven by ongoing developments in the nature of conflict and
international relations. It is also necessary to consider some of the
possible causes of future conflicts, in order to understand the actors
and their motivations. Finally, we examine how terrorism will be
integrated into this evolution of conflict, and what that will mean
for U.S. military forces.</p><br/>

<p class="lead">When describing the evolution of terrorism and the use of terror
through history, it is essential to remember that forms of society and
government in the past were significantly different than they are
today. Modern nation-states did not exist in their present form until
1648 (Treaty of Westphalia), and the state's monopoly on warfare, or
inter-state violence, is even more recent. The lack of central
governments made it impossible to use terror as a method of affecting
a political change, as there was no single dominant political
authority. Also, the absence of central authority meant that the game
of warfare was open to many more players. Instead of national armies,
a variety of non-sovereign nobility, mercenaries, leaders of religious
factions, or mercantile companies participated in warfare. Their
involvement in warfare was considered to be perfectly legitimate. This
is in contrast to the modern era, where nations go to war, but private
participation is actually illegal.</p><br/>

<ins><h3>Early Theories of Terrorism</h3></ins>

<p class="lead">Early practitioners of terrorism, such as the Zealots and the
Assassins did not leave any particular philosophy or doctrine on their
use of terrorism. With the exception of spectacular failures such as
Guy Fawkes' religiously inspired attempt to assassinate King James I
and both Houses of Parliament in England, terrorism did not separate
itself or progress beyond the normal practices of warfare at that
time. As political systems became more sophisticated, and political
authority was viewed as less of a divine gift and more as a social
construct, new ideas about political conflict developed.</p><br/>

<ins><h3>20th Century Evolution of Terrorism</h3></ins>
<img src="images/3.jpg" class="img-rounded" height="400" width="700">

<p class="lead">In the early years of the 20th Century nationalism and revolutionary
political ideologies were the principal developmental forces acting
upon terrorism. When the Treaty of Versailles redrew the map of Europe
after World War I by breaking up the Austro-Hungarian Empire and
creating new nations, it acknowledged the principle of
self-determination for nationalities and ethnic groups. This
encouraged minorities and ethnicities not receiving recognition to
campaign for independence or autonomy. However, in many cases
self-determination was limited to European nations and ethnic groups
and denied others, especially the colonial possessions of the major
European powers, creating bitterness and setting the stage for the
long conflicts of the anti-colonial period.</p><br/>

<p class="lead">In particular, Arab nationalists felt that they had been betrayed.
Believing they were promised post-war independence, they were doubly
disappointed; first when the French and British were given authority
over their lands; and then especially when the British allowed Zionist
immigration into Palestine in keeping with a promise contained in the
Balfour Declaration.</p><br/>

<p class="lead">Since the end of World War II, terrorism has accelerated its
development into a major component of contemporary conflict. Primarily
in use immediately after the war as a subordinate element of
anti-colonial insurgencies, it expanded beyond that role. In the
service of various ideologies and aspirations, terrorism sometimes
supplanted other forms of conflict completely. It also became a
far-reaching weapon capable of effects no less global than the
intercontinental bomber or missile. It has also proven to be a
significant tool of diplomacy and international power for states
inclined to use it.</p><br/>
