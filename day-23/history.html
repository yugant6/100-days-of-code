<h2>History of Terrorism</h2>
<p class="lead">
Terrorism has been a long-standing problem in our world for a very
long time. However, not all terrorist groups are created equally.
These 10 terrorist groups are the world’s most dangerous. No, we’re
not glorifying them – we’re bringing awareness to a problem that needs
to be addressed. Here are the world’s 10 most dangerous terrorist
groups.</p><br/>

<p class="lead"><ins>Number Ten</ins>: The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA). Operating out of Uganda,
the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo and
parts of southern Sudan, The Lord’s Resistance Army, or LRA, are a
terrorist group under the leadership of Joseph Kony. The group is
nearly defunct, but they have killed thousands.</p><br/>

<p class="lead"><ins>Number Nine</ins>: Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). This
terrorist group claims to be anti-imperialist, and they use guerrilla
tactics and violence to push their support of communism. They are
funded through trafficking and extortion, among other illegal means.</p><br/>

<p class="lead"><ins>Number Eight</ins>: Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan. On the border between
Pakistan and Afghanistan live a group called Tehrik-e Taliban
Pakistan. Their goal is to overthrow Pakistan’s government, and their
current leader is Mullah Fazlullah.<p><br/>

<p class="lead"><ins>Number Seven</ins>: Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Pictured above is Hafiz Saeed, the
leader of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Translating to Army of the Righteous,
Lashkar-e-Tayyiba operates around Pakistan and India, and they have no
problem attacking hundreds of innocent people.</p><br/>
<img src="images/10.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="400" height="300"><br/>
<p class="lead"><ins>Number Six</ins>: Al-Shabaab. Founded in 2006, the mission of terrorist
group Al-Shabaan is to stop Somalian foreign military forces. One of
their most devastating attacks occurred in 2015, when the group killed
148 students at a university in Kenya.</p><br/>

<p class="lead"><ins>Number Five</ins>: Hezbollah. Hezbollah means “party of Allah.” This
terrorist group was formed by Muslim clerics, and they have
representatives as high up as the cabinet of the Lebanese government,
meaning they are, as a whole, very powerful. They are also very
destructive and have killed many innocent civilians.</p><br/>

<p class="lead"><ins>Number Four</ins>: Boko Haram. Boko Haram is the worst terrorist group based
in West Africa. They have close ties with Al-Qaeda and are vehemently
anti-Western education. In fact, <ins>“Boko Haram” means “Western education
is sin.”</ins></p><br/>
<img src="images/9.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="400" height="300"><br/>

<p class="lead"><ins>Number Three</ins>: Taliban. Founded by Mullah Mohammed Omar in 1994, the
Taliban makes money via human and drug trafficking. They have killed
many innocent people, which they do in the name of jihad.<p><br/>

<p class="lead"><ins>Number Two</ins>: Al-Qaeda. Known for their role in the attacks on September
11, Al-Qaeda’s objective is to unify Muslims through jihad. The group
was founded by the late Osama bin Laden, and they have killed
thousands of innocent people in an effort to achieve their goal.</p><br/>
<img src="images/8.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="400" height="300">
<br/>

<p class="lead"><ins>Number One<ins>: ISIS. Finally, the world’s worst terrorist group is ISIS,
which stands for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. ISIS is 80,000
people strong and growing larger every day. They kill people
indiscriminately and are no strangers to abuse of all kinds. They
operate primarily in Iraq, Syria, Palestine and the Middle East and
have been linked to the attacks on Paris.</p><br/>
