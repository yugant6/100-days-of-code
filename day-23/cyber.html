<ins><h2>What is Cyber-terrorism?</h2></ins>

<p class="lead">In the wake of the recent computer attacks, many have been quick to
jump to conclusions that a new breed of terrorism is on the rise and
our country must defend itself with all possible means. As a society
we have a vast operational and legal experience and proved techniques
to combat terrorism, but are we ready to fight terrorism in the new
arena  cyber space?</p><br/>

<p class="lead">A strategic plan of a combat operation includes characterization of
the enemys goals, operational techniques, resources, and agents.
Prior to taking combative actions on the legislative and operational
front, one has to precisely define the enemy. That is, it is
imperative to expand the definition of terrorism to include
cyber-terrorism.</p><br/>

<p class="lead">As a society that prides itself on impartiality of justice, we must
provide clear and definitive legislative guidelines for dealing with
new breed of terrorism. As things stand now, justice cannot be served
as we have yet to provide a clear definition of the term. In this
light, I propose to re-examine our understanding of cyber-terrorism.</p><br/>

<p class="lead">There is a lot of misinterpretation in the definition cyber-terrorism,
the word consisting of familiar <ins>"cyber"<ins> and less familiar <ins>"terrorism".</ins>
While "cyber" is anything related to our tool of trade, terrorism by
nature is difficult to define. Even the U.S. government cannot agree
on one single definition. The old maxim, <ins>"One man's terrorist is
another man's freedom fighter" is still alive and well."</ins><br/>

<p class="lead">The ambiguity in the definition brings indistinctness in action, as D.
Denning pointed in her work Activism, Hactivism and Cyberterrorism,
<ins>"an e-mail bomb may be considered hacktivism by some and
cyber-terrorism by others"</ins></p>

<p class="lead">It follows that there is a degree of "understanding" of the meanings
of cyber-terrorism, either from the popular media, other secondary
sources, or personal experience; however, the specialists use
different definitions of the meaning. Cyber-terrorism as well as other
contemporary <ins>"terrorisms" (bioterrorism, chemical terrorism, etc.)</ins>
appeared as a mixture of words terrorism and a meaning of an area of
application. Barry Collin, a senior research fellow at the Institute
for Security and Intelligence in California, who in 1997 was
attributed for creation of the term <ins>"Cyberterrorism"</ins>, defined
cyber-terrorism as the convergence of cybernetics and terrorism. In
the same year Mark Pollitt, special agent for the FBI, offers a
working definition: <ins>"Cyberterrorism is the premeditated, politically
motivated attack against information, computer systems, computer
programs, and data which result in violence against noncombatant
targets by sub national groups or clandestine agents."</ins></p><br/>

<p class="lead">Since that time the word cyber-terrorism has entered into the lexicon
of IT security specialists and terrorist experts and the word list of
mass media "professionals". One of the experts, a police chief, offers
his version of definition: <ins>"Cyber-terrorism  attacking sabotage-prone
targets by computer  poses potentially disastrous consequences for
our incredibly computer-dependent society."</ins></p>
<br/>
<img src="images/6.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="700" height="300"><br/>
<p class="lead">A renowned expert Dorothy Denning defined cyber-terrorism as <ins>"unlawful
attacks and threats of attack against computers, networks, and the
information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a
government or its people in furtherance of political or social
objectives".</ins> R. Stark from the SMS University defines cyber-terrorism
as " any attack against an information function, regardless of the
means"</p><br/>

<p class="lead">Under the above-mentioned definitions of cyber-terrorism one can only
point to the fact that any telecommunications infrastructure attack,
including site defacing and other computer pranks, constitute
terrorism. It means that cyber-terrorism has already occurred and we
<ins>"live "</ins> in the epoch of cyber terror.</p>

<p class="lead">However, another expert, James Christy the law enforcement and
counterintelligence coordinator for the DIAP (Defense-wide Information
Assurance Program), which is steered by the office of the assistant
secretary of defense for command, control, communications and
intelligence, states that cyber-terrorism has never been waged against
the United States. "Rather, recent hacking events  including a 1998
web page set up by a supporter of the Mexican Zapatistas rebel group,
which led to attacks on the U.S. military from 1,500 locations in 50
different countries  constitute computer crime. William Church, a
former U.S. Army Intelligence officer, who founded the Center for
Infrastructural Warfare Studies (CIWARS) agrees that the United States
has not seen a cyber terrorist threat from terrorists using
information warfare techniques. "None of the groups that are
conventionally defined as terrorist groups have used information
weapons against the infrastructure" Richard Clarke, national
co-ordinator for security, infrastructure protection and
counterterrorism at the National Security Council offered to stop
using "cyberterrorism" and use <ins>"information warfare "</ins> instead

The above-mentioned observations drive a clear line between
cyber-terrorism and cyber crime and allow us to define cyber-terrorism
as: Use of information technology and means by terrorist groups and
agents.

In defining the cyber terrorist activity it is necessary to segment of
action and motivation. There is no doubt that acts of hacking can have
the same consequences as acts of terrorism but in the legal sense the
intentional abuse of the information cyberspace must be a part of the
terrorist campaign or an action.

Examples of cyber terrorist activity may include use of information
technology to organize and carry out attacks, support groups
activities and perception-management campaigns. Experts agree that
many terrorist groups such as Osama bin Ladenn organization and the
Islamic militant group Hamas have adopted new information technology
as a means to conduct operations without being detected by counter
terrorist officials.

Thus, use of information technology and means by terrorist groups and
agents constitute cyber-terrorism. Other activities, so richly
glamorized by the media, should be defined as cyber crime.</p><br/>
